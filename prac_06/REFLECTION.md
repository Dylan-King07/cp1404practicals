# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have changed how I do my practicals. At the beginning, I tried to sit down and do all of my practicals at once,
but now I do them in increments, and it makes completing them a lot easier.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think my attitude to the subject needs to change. 
I chose this subject for some coding experience for my physics major, however, I have discovered from this subject 
and subjects with coding aspects that I do not enjoy coding that much. This has been a mental roadblock which I've been
working around.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel as if my time management has become better over the course of the subject. I have created a set schedule which
has benefited me greatly in completing all assessments on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I have been struggling with naming conventions in this subject. So far, I have mostly gotten away with sub-par naming,
however, I have not had time to review the conventions yet and need to do so if I want full marks.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I do not really have any suggestions. The teaching style and instructions in this subject align almost perfectly with
my preferred learning style, it has made the subject very easy to understand for a complete novice.
