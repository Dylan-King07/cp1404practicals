# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was usually accurate to within 20 to 30 minutes of my estimate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved quite a bit. In the first few estimates I was usually off by 40 to 60 minutes.
I improved this to be around 20 to 30 minutes.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that you often have to anticipate unexpected roadblocks which can slow down the development
of your code and increase the time taken to write the code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I did not receive many code reviews. The ones I did receive helped me to identify the strengths
and weaknesses of my code. This benefited me in the practicals which came after.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing code reviews for other people helped me to see that there are different ways to implement code, which in some
cases actually revealed better ways which I could implement into my code. It also helped me reinforce my knowledge of
the style guide.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 6](https://github.com/Kye-Sta/CP1404_Practical/pull/2#issuecomment-3506390371)

### Explanation

In this code review, I was not given much information on what to look out for. However, I still reviewed the code,
provided an evaluation of the code and suggested how to improve the commit messages.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 7](https://github.com/zacgormly/cp1404practicals/pull/3#issuecomment-3538204132)

### Explanation

In this code review, I was asked to review the implementation of SRP and DRY. In each file, I reviewed how well these
principles were implemented. I picked up on small ways to improve the code and paid close attention to the Project
Management program, as specified in the code review request.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would probably decrease the size of one or two of the practicals. Most were a reasonable length, however, some, such 
as prac 6 dragged on. If I was in charge of the subject, I would decrease the size of this practical to be slightly
shorter, as even when I started it early, I still felt rushed for time.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I believe I managed my time really well. I had a lot of assessments this trimester and these practicals made up a
large proportion of these assessments. If I had not taken initiative and completed these practicals early in the week,
I would have been a lot worse off this trimester, and I believe starting them early greatly influenced
my overall grade in these practicals.
