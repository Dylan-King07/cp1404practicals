# CP1404 Practicals
Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About Me
I am 18 years old and am a first year advanced science student doing a physics major. I am completing CP1404 to gain
important coding experience for my course.

## 3 Lessons I have learned about "clean code"
- **Importance of naming conventions** Naming your functions, variables and constants properly and deliberately
is important for readability and understandability in a program.
- **Single responsibility principle** Ensuring that all functions complete a single clear task helps make the code
easier to follow and understand.
- **DRY principle** When coding, it is important to not repeat code. This makes code less cluttered, as unnecessary 
lines are not cluttering the code and making it more complex.
