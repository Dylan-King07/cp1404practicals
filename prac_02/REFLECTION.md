# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

Around 70 to 80%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have scheduled my lecture videos to be watched in the slots where I have free time at uni or after I have completed all my work at my job. At the moment, I have Tuesday afternoon and Thursday morning free so I usually watch the lectures then.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel like I am note taking well and I am referring to my notes effectively when completing the tests and practicals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I am very narrow sighted, which has led to many problems with the way I code. I have found myself struggling to understand the full picture of a problem when I do the practicals and this often impedes my progress.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Currently, I feel as if I am not understanding the instructions very well. I have found myself asking my peers to explain what the prac is asking me to do quite often. This is probably a symptom of my narrow sightedness.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I feel as if I am writing code which follows the proper conventions pretty well.
